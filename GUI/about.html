                We are planning to work on a face recognition system for our senior design
                project. 
                This software product aims to identify and recognize individuals, 
                particularly students, based on specific facial characteristics such as eyes and mouth. 
                The primary users targeted are colleges and universities. 
                The general architecture of our software product comprises five key components: 
                data collection, image processing, face detection, face recognition, and database management.
